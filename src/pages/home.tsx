    <h1>Cells Flasher</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Cells Flasher, the game that makes Cells Flash!</p>
    <p>What is the goal of the game? There is none!</p>
    <p>
      This is just an "app" that you can use to draw flashing pixel art. You can
      click, or draw, and the grid you chose will fill itself with
      alternate-colored cells.
    </p>
    <p>For extra fun, triplets of neighbor cells will flash in unisson.</p>
    <p>
      For even more fun, a countdown is set between each move you make, so don't
      think too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, each time the countdown reaches zero, your "art" is automatically
      saved in your browser localStorage. You also have the possibility to save
      your "art" and see it later in the section "Previous Arts".
    </p>
    <p>Have Fun!</p>
